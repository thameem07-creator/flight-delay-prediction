###Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning
##Project Overview
This project aims to predict flight delays using machine learning algorithms. Flight delays can cause significant inconvenience to passengers and airlines, leading to financial losses and operational inefficiencies. By leveraging historical flight data, this project builds predictive models to estimate whether a flight will be delayed or not.

The project uses two machine learning algorithms: Random Forest and XGBoost, to classify flights as either delayed or not delayed. The models are trained on a dataset containing flight information, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

##Causes of Flight Delays
Flight delays can occur due to various reasons, including:

#Weather Conditions:
Adverse weather such as storms, fog, or heavy rain.

#Air Traffic Congestion: 
High traffic at airports or in airspace.

#Technical Issues: 
Mechanical problems with the aircraft.

#Operational Delays: 
Late arrival of crew or aircraft from previous flights.

#Security Issues: 
Security breaches or extended security checks.

#Airport Operations: 
Delays in baggage handling, refueling, or boarding.

Predicting delays helps airlines and passengers plan better, reducing the impact of these issues.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical flight data. The dataset includes the following features:

#ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID: Unique identifier for the origin airport.

#ORIGIN: Airport code of the origin airport (e.g., SFO, LAX).

#DEST: Airport code of the destination airport.

#DEP_TIME: Scheduled departure time of the flight.

#DEP_DEL15: Target variable indicating whether the flight was delayed by more than 15 minutes (1 = Delayed, 0 = Not Delayed).

#The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical features for machine learning.

##Algorithms Used
#Random Forest Classifier:

An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for improved accuracy and robustness.

Used for its ability to handle large datasets and avoid overfitting.

#XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):

A scalable and efficient implementation of gradient boosting.

Known for its high performance and ability to handle complex datasets.

Both algorithms are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

##Code Implementation
The project includes the following steps:

#Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values in the dataset.

Encoding categorical features (e.g., origin and destination airport codes) using LabelEncoder.

#Feature Selection:

Selecting relevant features such as ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID, ORIGIN, DEST, and DEP_TIME.

#Model Training:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Training the Random Forest and XGBoost models.

#Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

#Prediction:

A function is provided to predict flight delays for new input data using both models.

##Applications
#Airlines:

Optimize flight schedules and resource allocation.

Reduce operational costs by minimizing delays.

#Passengers:

Receive timely notifications about potential delays.

Plan travel schedules more effectively.

#Airport Authorities:

Improve airport operations and reduce congestion.

#Travel Agencies:

Provide better travel recommendations to customers.

##Results
The models' performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

#Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified flights.

#Confusion Matrix: Breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

#Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
