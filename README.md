# Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning

## **Project Overview**
Flight delays are a major inconvenience for both passengers and airlines, leading to increased costs, wasted time, and disrupted schedules. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a flight will be delayed based on various features, enabling better planning and decision-making for all stakeholders.

## **Causes of Flight Delays**
Flight delays can be attributed to numerous factors, including:
- **Weather Conditions**: Severe weather, such as storms or snow, can delay departures and arrivals.
- **Air Traffic Congestion**: Busy airports and air routes can cause delays in flight schedules.
- **Mechanical Issues**: Aircraft maintenance and unexpected technical problems.
- **Crew Availability**: Delays in crew schedules or compliance with working hour regulations.
- **Airport Operations**: Delays in baggage handling, refueling, or gate changes.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, titled `flight_delay.csv`. It includes historical flight data with the following key attributes:
- **ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID**: Unique identifier for the origin airport.
- **ORIGIN**: Code of the origin airport (e.g., SFO, JFK).
- **DEST**: Code of the destination airport (e.g., LAX, ORD).
- **DEP_TIME**: Scheduled departure time (in minutes since midnight).
- **DEP_DEL15**: Target variable indicating whether a flight was delayed (1 for delayed, 0 for on-time).

### **Data Preprocessing**
To ensure the dataset is ready for machine learning:
- Missing values were handled by imputing with the mean for numeric features and filling with default values for target labels.
- Categorical variables such as `ORIGIN` and `DEST` were encoded using Label Encoding.
- The dataset was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## **Machine Learning Algorithms Used**
Two machine learning models were implemented and compared for prediction:

### **1. Random Forest Classifier**
A robust ensemble-based classification algorithm that works by constructing multiple decision trees and taking a majority vote for predictions.
- **Advantages**: Handles overfitting well and performs effectively on complex datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

### **2. XGBoost Classifier**
A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that optimizes performance through parallel processing and regularization techniques.
- **Advantages**: High accuracy and efficiency, with support for handling missing values.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## **Applications of Flight Delay Prediction**
This project has wide-ranging applications in aviation and beyond:
- **Airlines**: Optimize flight schedules, reduce operational costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Airports**: Enhance resource allocation and minimize congestion during peak hours.
- **Passengers**: Provide real-time insights to plan travel more effectively.
- **Government and Regulators**: Develop policies to improve overall air traffic efficiency and reduce delays.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Incorporating additional features such as weather data, distance, and carrier information.
- Exploring deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- Deployment of the model as a web-based or mobile application for real-time predictions.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to tackle real-world problems in aviation. By predicting flight delays, it provides actionable insights for better decision-making and enhances the overall travel experience for all stakeholders.
